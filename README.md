GraalLoader - Sponge

A loader for graal

This is unmaintained and will not be updated.

My reasoning is that while using Ruby and other languages to write mods is a little easier, it doesn't leverage what 
the language has to offer and you end up with more bugs and issues then if you had simply programmed
the plugin in Java.

Not only that but nothing was solid.

Sometimes it might close or things would break for no good reason.

Ultimately this was a semi-successful test but I won't be using this.

No usage instructions for now, maybe one day..
